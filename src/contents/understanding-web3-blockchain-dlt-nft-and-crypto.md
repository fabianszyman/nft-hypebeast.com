When it comes to blockchain, crypto and web3, the terms can seem confusing. However, understanding these concepts is key to unlocking the potential of the blockchain and crypto space. In this article, we’ll explain what web3, blockchain, and crypto are, how they work, and why they’re important.

## What is Web3?

Web3 is a term used to refer to the third generation of internet technology, which is focused on decentralizing the web. Web3 includes blockchain technology, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts. Web3 is about creating a secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer network that is free from any centralised control.

Think of web3 like a decentralized library. Instead of having one centralised location where all the books are stored and maintained, the library is spread out across multiple locations. Everyone can access the library, and all the books are kept secure and up-to-date. The idea behind web3 is to create a decentralised network that is secure, transparent, and resistant to centralised control.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) that is used to record digital transactions. It is a secure, immutable, and transparent way of storing data. Think of it like a digital ledger that is shared among multiple parties. Every transaction that is recorded is linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks, hence the term “blockchain”.

Think of blockchain like a digital spreadsheet that is shared among multiple parties. Every time someone makes a transaction, it is recorded in the spreadsheet, creating a chain of blocks. This chain of blocks is secure, immutable, and transparent, meaning that everyone can see the chain, but no one can change or tamper with it. This makes blockchain an ideal technology for recording digital transactions.

## What is Distributed ledger technology (DLT)?

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a type of database technology that is used to record digital transactions. DLT is secure, immutable, and transparent, meaning that all parties involved in a transaction can view the data, but no one can change or tamper with it. DLT is at the heart of blockchain technology, and is used to create a secure, transparent, and efficient way of recording digital transactions.

A real life example of DLT is a shared digital Notepad. Every time someone makes a transaction, it is recorded in the Notepad, creating a chain of blocks. This chain of blocks is secure, immutable, and transparent, meaning that everyone can see the chain, but no one can change or tamper with it. This makes DLT an ideal technology for recording digital transactions.

## What is NFT?

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a type of digital asset that are unique, immutable, and securely stored on the blockchain. They are used to represent a wide range of digital assets, including artwork, collectibles, game items, and digital tokens. NFTs are becoming increasingly popular, as they provide a secure and transparent way of owning digital assets.

A real life example of an NFT is a digital painting. The painting is stored on the blockchain, and the owner of the painting is the only one who can control it. The painting is unique, immutable, and securely stored on the blockchain, meaning that it cannot be duplicated or tampered with. The owner of the painting can also trade or sell the painting, as long as they have the digital key that allows them to access it.

## What is Crypto?

Crypto is short for “cryptocurrency”, which is a digital form of money. Crypto is designed to be secure, anonymous, and decentralised, meaning it is not controlled.

Think of crypto like digital cash. It is a digital form of money. Crypto can be used to buy goods and services online, as well as to send money to other people. It is becoming increasingly popular as a form of digital payment, as it is fast, secure, and does not require any centralised control.
