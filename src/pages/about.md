# Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabian, and I'm a Product Manager from Munich with over 5 years of experience in IT. While I being in charge of numerous IT-projects covering Front-End, Back-End and Native Apps, I recently developed a strong interesed in Crypto, NFT and Blockchain technology. So that I've decided to start jump into writing code myself and reading about this industry.

As a Product Manager, I've always been interested in staying up to date with the latest and greatest technologies. However, I've never had the desire or time to dive deep into coding. That's why I've decided to start this blog to document my progress as I learn how to code and explore the world of Crypto, NFTs and Blockchain. I'm excited to begin this new experience and share my journey with you!

So stay tuned for more updates!
